//! Prompts, text entry, raw-terminal handling, widgets and the supervisor that restores a sane terminal after a crash. This is the module that reads stdin, and the only one that does.
//!
//! This file is the module's public surface. `lib.zig` is the folder's own
//! re-export list, and its declarations are inherited below so that a consumer writes
//! `interact.thing` rather than `interact.lib.thing` - which is how this folder was reached
//! before the module split.

    // sub-modules. A subdirectory missing from that list loses its tests silently
    // rather than failing the build - see ROADMAP.md M-2.
